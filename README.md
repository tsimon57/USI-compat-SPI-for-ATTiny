USI-compat-SPI-for-ATTiny
=========================

USART and USI support for writing to LED strings

Still works as usual for USART based non-ATTiny85

Compile time directives added to use USI on ATTiny85. Code was lifted from AVR docs
Only for writing to LEDS, etc. No read capability. Many functions stubbed out.
